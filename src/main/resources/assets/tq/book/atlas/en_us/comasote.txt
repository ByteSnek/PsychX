Comasote (not to be confused     with the actual dimension name 'Comatose') is a very... strange acting fluid. It is mainly found in the Surreal and Spectral biomes
<NEWLINE>
When an entity touches Comasote, a few things happen, firstly if the entity touching it is a player and the dimension they are in has a daylight cycle, then it will speed up the daylight
<NEWLINE>
cycle (it does not tick accelerate anything).
Secondly the entity touching the fluid will constantly take NaN (not a number) amount of damage. This means the entity will technically never die but will constantly take 'imaginary' damage
<NEWLINE>
If an item is dropped in Comasote it will have a 1/50 chance of disappearing and flinging random minecraft particles every tick
