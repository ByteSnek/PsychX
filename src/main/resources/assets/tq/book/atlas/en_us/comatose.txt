To get to the Comatose dimension you need to use a Tourniquet on yourself and pass out
<NEWLINE>
When you first wake up in the Dimension you will have an "rgb shift" vision effect signalling that you are, in fact, in a coma. This vision effect can be disabled in the config
<NEWLINE>
In the top left hand corner you will have a coma stage
<NEWLINE>
counter that, by default, has a 1/10,000 chance of incrementing every tick. The coma stage ui placement/visibility and coma stage incrementation can be modified in the config
<NEWLINE>
When this counter reaches 10/10 you will wake up from your coma and you will return to normal
<NEWLINE>
The Comatose dimension also has it's own unique fluid type called Comasote (not to be confused with the actual dimension name)
<NEWLINE>
The Comatose dimension is still very much a work in progress and lots of stuff is yet to be added to it
